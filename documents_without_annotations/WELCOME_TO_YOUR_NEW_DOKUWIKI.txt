WELCOME TO YOUR NEW DOKUWIKI

Congratulations, your wiki is now up and running. Here are a few more tips to get you started.

Enjoy your work with DokuWiki, â€“ the developers

CREATE YOUR FIRST PAGES

Your wiki needs to have a start page. As long as it doesn't exist, this link will be red: start (https://wiki.student.uni-goettingen.de/start) .

Go on, follow that link and create the page. If you need help with using the syntax you can always refer to the syntax page (https://wiki.student.uni-goettingen.de/wiki/syntax) .

You might also want to use a sidebar. To create it, just edit the sidebar (https://wiki.student.uni-goettingen.de/sidebar) page. Everything in that page will be shown in a margin column on the side. Read our FAQ on sidebars (https://www.dokuwiki.org/faq%3Asidebar) to learn more.

Please be aware that not all templates support sidebars.

CUSTOMIZE YOUR WIKI

Once you're comfortable with creating and editing pages you might want to have a look at the configuration settings (https://wiki.student.uni-goettingen.de/doku.php?do=admin&page=config) (be sure to login as superuser first).

You may also want to see what plugins (https://www.dokuwiki.org/plugins) and templates (https://www.dokuwiki.org/templates) are available at DokuWiki.org to extend the functionality and looks of your DokuWiki installation.

JOIN THE COMMUNITY

DokuWiki is an Open Source project that thrives through user contributions. A good way to stay informed on what's going on and to get useful tips in using DokuWiki is subscribing to the newsletter (https://www.dokuwiki.org/newsletter) .

The DokuWiki User Forum (https://forum.dokuwiki.org) is an excellent way to get in contact with other DokuWiki users and is just one of the many ways to get support (https://www.dokuwiki.org/faq%3Asupport) .

Of course we'd be more than happy to have you getting involved (https://www.dokuwiki.org/teams%3Agetting_involved) with DokuWiki.
